# DogGPT
*What if ChatGPT were a dog?

ChatGPT is boring. I want a cat to answer my questions. So I built DogGPT!

## Demo
Try DogGpt [thedoggybrad.github.io/dogpt/](https://thedoggybrad.github.io/dogpt/)

## How?
The "DogGPT' is a fork of the popular "CatGPT". 

## Why?
I made this site for fun, by forking "CatGPT". I was just thinking on what will happen if I change all references to a dog. And, this is the result.
