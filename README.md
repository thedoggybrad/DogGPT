# DogGPT
ChatGPT is boring. I want a dog to answer my questions. So here is DogGPT.
<br>
Ask some questions to a dog online and start to be irritated because you cannot understand what the dog is saying.

## Demo
Try DogGpt [thedoggybrad.github.io/dogpt/](https://thedoggybrad.github.io/dogpt/)

## How?
The "DogGPT' is a fork of the popular "CatGPT". After forking, I changed all the references to a cat to a dog (atleast to those visible in the chat). Then, I introduce some improvements to it.

## Why?
I made this site for fun, by forking "CatGPT". I was just thinking on what will happen if I change all references to a dog. And, this is the result.

Note: No Artificial Intelligence (AI) was really used. It just uses some sorts of randomizers running under JavaScript.
